# Web Application
Remake of Project 1 - Web Application

### Disclaimer
There is a chance for Spotify API to change their API setup (e.g. different endpoint name), if something does not load within the app, it is likely because of that - I would check that first.

## Running the project
To run current (or any) version of this project, first create and activate a virtual Python environment.

### Creating a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .[venv name]
```

### Activating the virtual environment
Windows:
```bash
.[venv name]\Scripts\activate
```

Unix or MacOS:
```bash
source .[venv name]/bin/activate
```

## Dependencies
After creating and activating the virtual environment, you have to install the required packages, running:
```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```
