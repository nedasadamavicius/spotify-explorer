# Web Application - Spotify Explorer

## Disclaimer

There is a chance for Spotify API to change their API setup (e.g., different endpoint name).
If something does not load within the app, it is likely because of that ‚Äî check API endpoints first.

## üöÄ Running the Project

You can run the project using **Docker Compose** (recommended) or set it up manually using **Python virtual environments**. Both sections can be read standalone, so you don't need to jump back and forth.

---

### üê≥ Docker Compose (recommended)

This is the easiest way to run the app for **both development** and **production**.

---

#### üì¶ 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nedasadamavicius/spotify-explorer.git
cd spotify-explorer
```

---

#### üîë 2. Define environment variables

From the same **repository root** directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SECRET_KEY=your-secret
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
STATIC_ROOT=/static
```

For production, set `DEBUG=False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com`, and `STATIC_ROOT=/var/www/webapp/static/` - or anywhere you want Django to collect static files to, just make sure you can serve those static files.

---

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About environment variables

* **SPOTIFY\_CLIENT\_ID / SPOTIFY\_CLIENT\_SECRET**
  Get these from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
  Create an app there to retrieve your credentials.

* **SECRET\_KEY**
  This is required by Django for cryptographic signing.
  Generate a strong secret key with:

  ```bash
  python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
  ```

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this key safe and never commit it to version control.**

---

#### üèÉ 3. Start the app

From the **repository root**, for development run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

* Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

And if production:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up --build -d
```

* Then visit the domain you've defined in the `.env` file

---

#### üîÑ Common Docker commands

Run Django management commands inside the container:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate --noinput
```

---

### üêç Python Virtual Environment (manual setup)

This is the **legacy setup** for running the app without Docker. Works for **both development** and **production**.

---

#### üì¶ 1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

---

#### üîë 2. Activate the virtual environment

* On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

* On **Unix/MacOS**:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

#### üì• 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

#### üîë 4. Define environment variables

From the same **repository root** directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your credentials:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
SECRET_KEY=your-secret
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
STATIC_ROOT=/static
```

For production, set `DEBUG=False`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-domain.com`, and `STATIC_ROOT=/var/www/webapp/static/` - or anywhere you want Django to collect static files to, just make sure you can serve those static files.

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è About environment variables

* **SPOTIFY\_CLIENT\_ID / SPOTIFY\_CLIENT\_SECRET**
  Get these from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
  Create an app there to retrieve your credentials.

* **SECRET\_KEY**
  This is required by Django for cryptographic signing.
  Generate a strong secret key with:

  ```bash
  python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
  ```

  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this key safe and never commit it to version control.**

---

#### üèÉ 5. Start the app

Navigate to the Django project root:

```bash
cd WebProject
```

For development:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

* Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

And if production (recommended to use Gunicorn):

```bash
gunicorn WebProject.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 3
```

* Then visit the domain you‚Äôve defined in the `.env` file.

---

#### üîÑ Common management commands

Run Django commands manually:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py migrate --noinput
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Start background services (required for both dev and prod)

This app uses **Redis** and **Celery** for background tasks.
If you are not using Docker, you need to set them up manually.

* **Redis**: Django and Celery require a running Redis server.
  Start it on your system (install Redis via your OS package manager). Example:

  ```bash
  # On Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt install redis-server
  sudo systemctl enable redis-server
  sudo systemctl start redis-server
  ```

  Confirm Redis is running:

  ```bash
  redis-cli ping
  # Should return: PONG
  ```

* **Celery Worker**: To process background jobs.
  From the Django project root:

  ```bash
  celery -A WebProject worker --loglevel=info
  ```

* **Celery Beat**: To run periodic tasks.
  From the Django project root:

  ```bash
  celery -A WebProject beat --loglevel=info
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid restarting these processes manually on every reboot, configure them with **systemd** or **supervisord**.

## üìù Notes

* Make sure you have Python 3.12+ installed.
* For Docker Compose, you need Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux).
* If you're on a typical Windows environment, you might have to use `docker-compose` instead of `docker compose`, everything else is the same.
